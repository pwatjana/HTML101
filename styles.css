/*Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
